## FILL UP TETRIS
FILL UP TETRIS GAME USING C++ AND RAYLIB 
The objective of Tetris is to manipulate falling blocks, called "tetrominoes," to create horizontal lines without gaps. When a line is completed, it disappears, and any blocks above it fall down. The game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing field.
